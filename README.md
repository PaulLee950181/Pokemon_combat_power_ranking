# Pokemon_combat_power_ranking

The problem is to construct a real-time Pokemon combat power leader board.

We have some commands lead to special function, 

'I' : 
Add a Pokemon to the combat power leader board（given ID and combat power）.

'D' : 
Remove a Pokemon from the combat power leader board（given ID and combat power）.

'R' : 
Given a ranking, output its ID and combat power.

'V' : 
Given a combat power, output its ranking.

'B' : 
Given a range of combat power, output its highest and lowest ranking.

'A' : 
Given a range of ranking, output its highest and lowest combat power.

The program used red-black tree and augmenting data structures.

# Pokemon_combat_power_ranking

The problem is to construct a real-time Pokemon combat power leader board.

We have some commands lead to special function, 
'I' : Add a Pokemon to the combat power leader board（given ID and combat power）.
'D' : Remove a Pokemon from the combat power leader board（given ID and combat power）.
'R' : Given a ranking, output its ID and combat power.
'V' : Given a combat power, output its ranking.
'B' : Given a range of combat power, output its highest and lowest ranking.
'A' : Given a range of ranking, output its highest and lowest combat power.

Used red-black tree and augmenting data structures.
